== Introduction

Continuous Integration (CI) has become an essential practice in the software development industry due to its many benefits. The process involves frequently integrating code changes from multiple developers into a shared repository and then running automated tests to ensure that the new changes do not break existing functionality. This test report, validates the linux firmware through the use of Savoir-faire Linux's open-source tool cukinia. cukinia is integrated with Yocto and allows for the testing of Linux embedded distributions, including applications statuses, kernel and devices configuration, filesystems, and networks. By utilizing continuous integration, we are able to identify issues earlier in the development process, improve code quality, and increase the overall efficiency of our software development.
